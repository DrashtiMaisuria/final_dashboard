# final_dashboard: Housing Affordability by Square Footage & Crime Rate

This RShiny dashboard explores housing trends across ZIP codes in the U.S., with a focus on how square footage, crime rate, and home characteristics relate to affordability.

## Dashboard Features

- Two interactive **Plotly scatter plots**:
  - One shows the **10 ZIP codes with the highest crime rates**
  - The other shows the **10 ZIP codes with the lowest crime rates**
